# 🐻 FerrazGuardian: The Ultimate Rotation for Elite Guardians

**Dominate Mythic+ 20 (and beyond) with the security of Intelligent Automation.**

`FerrazGuardian.yaml` is not just a rotation script; it is your trusted co-pilot for tanking the highest keys in World of Warcraft. Specifically designed for the **Elune's Chosen** build, this profile combines unbreakable survivability with optimized damage, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: **leading your group.**

## 🚀 Why Choose FerrazGuardian?

### 🛡️ **Automated & Intelligent Survivability**
Stop guessing when to use your defensives. FerrazGuardian monitors your health and damage intake in real-time to make critical decisions for you:
- **Adaptive Ironfur:** Maintains minimum stacks for constant mitigation and automatically "spams" extra stacks when damage spikes.
- **Emergency Defensives:** Automatically triggers `Survival Instincts` and `Barkskin` in moments of danger (e.g., HP below 50%).
- **Reactive Healing:** Uses `Frenzied Regeneration` precisely when your health drops, ensuring you never stay in the red.

### 🔥 **Optimized Damage (Elune's Chosen)**
Don't just be a meat shield. Be a lethal threat.
- **Lunar Synergy:** Perfectly manages the `Lunar Beam` and `Moonfire` combo, guaranteeing bursts of Arcane damage.
- **Raze & Maul Spam:** Spends Rage offensively whenever you are safe, shredding packs with `Raze` or destroying single targets with `Maul`.
- **Dot Management:** Keeps `Thrash` and `Moonfire` active on all targets 100% of the time.

### 🧠 **"God Tank" Utility**
Small details that separate good tanks from great ones:
- **Auto-Kick:** Instantly interrupts enemies (with configurable delay to appear human).
- **Ironclad Aggro:** Automatically uses `Growl` (taunt) on any enemy that dares to look at your healer.
- **Fluid Movement:** Activates `Stampeding Roar` and `Travel Form` so you never fall behind.

## ⚙️ Total Control in Your Hands

Despite all the automation, **you are in command**. The profile comes with a complete configuration menu where you set the rules:

| Setting | What does it do? |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Survival Instincts %** | Choose at what health % you want the "panic button" to activate. |
| **Ironfur Stacks** | Define how many stacks to maintain by default and how many for burst windows. |
| **Rage Cap** | Decide how much Rage to bank for emergencies vs. spending on damage. |
| **Interrupt Delay** | Adjust the kick reaction time to look more natural or super-human. |
